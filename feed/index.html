<h2>The Happiness Hypothesis</h2>
<p>These simple survey measures seem credible.

<p>In other words, happiness may be an element achieved by:</p>

<p>In order to get everyone on the same page, with the right incentives, we have to accomplish a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to investors.</strong> Our investors took a huge bet on us and they deserved to get a handsome return.</li>
<li><strong>Return to employees.</strong> Our team also took a big bet on us over the years by investing their time. They deserved a return as well.</li>
<li><strong>Stock options.</strong> If we weren’t planning to sell the company, giving employees stock options didn’t make sense. We needed a new way for the team to share in the success of the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “preference-based” perspective starts from the idea that people are better off when their reality matches better what they themselves consider to be important.</p>

<li><strong>Return to employees.</strong> Our team also took a big bet on us over the years by investing their time. They deserved a return as well.</li>

<p>In order to get everyone on the same page, with the right incentives, we have to accomplish a few things:</p>

<li><strong>Return to investors.</strong> Our investors took a huge bet on us and they deserved to get a handsome return.</li>
<li><strong>Return to employees.</strong> Our team also took a big bet on us over the years by investing their time. They deserved a return as well.</li>

<p>As you’re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably <a href="#">don’t give much thought</a> to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity — just that they’re <em>chipping</em> away at your battery life.</p>
<p>It’s engaging. It’s <strong>hopeful</strong>. It pushes the plot forward.</p>

<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>
<h3>Current Mobile Cloud</h3>
<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1–2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that’s opaque, because we can’t see it directly.</p>
